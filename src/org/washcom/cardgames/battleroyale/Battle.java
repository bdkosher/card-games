/**
 * A battle is ambiguously both a) the name for a round and b) the name for a
 * round that has no decisive winner after the first set of cards are played.
 *
 * Battles can extend for up to three continuations. On the final continuation,
 * no additional fees will be played. If the final continuation results in no
 * clear winner, the player NOT participating the battle gets the cards--this is
 * analagous to two armies duking it out so brutally that they kill each other,
 * leaving a non-participating army to swoop in and collect all of the loot.
 *
 * It's theoretically possible for a three-way battle to extend up through the
 * final continuation and result in no clear winner. I've never witnessed such
 * an event, so it must be rare and is thusly implemented by throwing an
 * Exception, which the Game class will catch and deal with appropriately.
